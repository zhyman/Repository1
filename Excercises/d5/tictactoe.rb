# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# using a counter, if its odd, player 1's turn, if it's even, player 2's turn.

# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another arrayâ€”it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
#hash, with number of box as key, "X" or "O" as value.

# When a player makes a move, what should happen?
# adds to the hash if not there already

# How do you keep track of which squares have Xs and which have Os?
#using the hash

# How do you detect a winner?
# check if the rows/columns/diagonals have the same values in the hash 

# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?
# when someone wins or the games over, the boolean that runs the while loop changes
