## The bru's personal page
#### May 27, 2014

## Overview

#### Motivation

- What do I want to say with this page? What's its purpose?
- What's the target audience? Friends/family? Employers? Groupies?
- Is this a professional page, a portfolio? Just for fun, a design playground?

#### Content

- What do I want to actually put on it? Suggestions:
- Links to things you've made (photos, videos, class projects)
- Yet another blog
- A self intro, with links to how to contact you (FB, Github, etc.)
- Be as specific as you can here

## Design

- What's the look and feel of it? Minimalist? Intricate? Goth?
- You'll do a lot more of this when we start thinking about CSS.
- Will you use images? Icons? From where?
- Do some research! Look at other sites for inspiration.

## Code

You'll be using HTML and CSS, but as you think about your layout,
you might want to start thinking about logical sections of the page
(header, footer, sidebarâ€”if you want any of these things),
and how you might structure those with HTML.
